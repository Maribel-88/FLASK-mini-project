## **Our To Do List**
 A website project created to showcase what I have learnt so far from course modules.
 This dynamic website is composed of six pages , the Home page, Profile, New Task, Manage Categories, Login, Register page.
 In all the pages there are buttons that customers can click in order to go the the desired page. This website is built with customer in mind.
 I am looking for the web visitors to be able to create, read, update, and delete their tasks.


 ### [Home Page](https://flask-task-manager-mp-9d894f1cee7e.herokuapp.com/get_tasks)
 In the home page , I have implemented some Materialize , HTML , CSS in order to
 make the page more interactive and user friendly. Font awesome icons made  the web page more engaging.
